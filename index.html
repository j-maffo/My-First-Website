      When it comes to extracurricular activities I am part of the school's
      Interac club as I like to volunteer and love being involved in school

      I am a big fan of reading and I mainly read novels or webtoons. My family
      is very important to me, so during the weekends or days when I'm free from
      school I spend my time with them.
